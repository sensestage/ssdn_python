Getting started with your MiniBees:

=====
XBees
=====

If you did not buy the MiniBees in a kit, you will need to configure your XBees as described on:
http://sensestage.hexagram.ca/xbee-choice-andconfiguration


========
MiniBees
========

These should be ready to go.


===========
DataNetwork
===========
Install the DataNetwork standalone host, or the packages within SuperCollider
http://sensestage.hexagram.ca/downloads

Start the Standalone, or within SuperCollider:

x = SWDataNetwork.new.createHost;
x.makeGui;

=========
PYDONHIVE
=========
Pydonhive is a python client for the datanetwork that will talk to the MiniBees and send data to the datanetwork, or send data from the datanetwork to the MiniBees.

You start it with:
$ python swpydonhive.py -c nameofconfigfile.xml -s /dev/ttyUSB0

/dev/ttyUSB0 is the address of your serial port, it will be different on a mac (something like: /dev/tty-ASSFADF0002332).

If you are using the API mode on the XBees then you start with:
$ python swpydonhive.py -c nameofconfigfile.xml -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -a True

If the DataNetwork host is running on another machine:
$ python swpydonhive.py -c nameofconfigfile.xml -d 192.168.0.7
where 192.168.0.7 is the IP address of the DataNetwork.
You can see the actual IP address of the DataNetwork in the DataNetwork GUI.

===========
YOUR CLIENT
===========

To get the data from the MiniBees in your environment, you have to subscribe to the data.
If your MiniBee got id 1, e.g. in Pd or Max you would create a dn.node object that listens to id 1.

PureData:
dn.node 1

Max:
dn.node clientName 1


To send data to a node, you use dn.mapnode
dn.mapnode 500 3 2
will make a node 500 with 3 slots, and tell the DataNetwork to map the data to the outputs of MiniBee with ID 2.
