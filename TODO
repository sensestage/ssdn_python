SPI - pins?




minihiveosc:
  - implement actual query responses

pydonhive:
  saving new config -> different autoname, and improve the instructions as to which name to use.
  
  graceful exit when serial port not opened
  
  if TWI is defined, then use pins A4 and A5 for that, no need to configure it

pydon:
  - create datanode if none present (in reply to subscribed)
  + reageert niet op announce message? - fixed!
  - add current minibee nodes!
  
  - test creating nodes
  - test subscribing to nodes
  - test using node data
  - add action for node data

 --- /quit - still an error upon datanetwork quit
 --- /error handling - could implement
 --- /expected - could do something with all arguments
 --- /info/client - could do something with this data. maybe as a callback from /query/clients
 --- /info/setter - could do something with this data. maybe as a callback from /query/setters
 
 
 --- setting callbacks:
      - unsubscribeNode
      - subscribeSlot and unsubscribeSlot
      - registerHive and unregisterHive
      - (un)mapping bees
 --- handling callbacks:
      - set_registered_hive

  minibee integration:
    - handle (un)map minibee request
    - handle (un)map minibee custom request

pydonhive:
  - custom config parsing in MiniBee
  - threaded approach to reading serial interface, maybe set a callback function?
  - loopback message is configured how?
  - timed playback when more than 1 sample per message is used
  - clever deduction that if TWI devices are configured, pins A4 and A5 are used for TWI
 
  + connect met pydon!
  
 
xml:
  + reading in a hive configuration from file (returns a dictionary with the info)
  - adding names for pinconfigs, which can be used as labels in the datanetwork
  - custom config writing and parsing
  - pretty file writing
  
MiniBee:
  + accelerometer data? what format? --> solved now
  - but, interesting would be:
    - make use of other options available for accelerometer
  
  - i2c needs to be ordered in pydonhive
  - me_led cannot be changed yet. but only important for exp. boards EXpree, so don't worry about it?
